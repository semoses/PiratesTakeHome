This is the readme for the Pitching App.

To view the Pitching App, download the repo, navigate to the PitchingApp folder once unzipped, and open the pitchingApp.html page in your browser.  Please ensure that you donâ€™t move any of the graph images out of the PitchingGraphs folder.
Note: I tested with Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, so those are all suitable browsers.

As for technologies used, the page itself was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the graphs were generated using R. I included a markdown file of my R code within the PitchingApp folder.
Screenshots of the app itself are included in the AppScreenshots folder.

Happy Pitching!
